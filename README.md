# Multi-modal-cyber-attack-detection
The growing number of cyber-attacks against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) in recent years elevates cyber-security concerns and their catastrophic impacts on these systems. Considering the complex nature of ICS, detecting a cyber-attack in them is extremely challenging and demands the exploitation of various data modalities. This research aims to utilize network and sensor modalities of ICS to propose the first deep multi-modal cyber-attack detection model for ICS. The evaluation results using the Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) system show that the proposed model can outperform the existing single modality models and recent works in the literature by achieving 0.99 precision, 0.98 recall, and 0.98 f-measure, which shows the effectiveness of using both modalities in detecting cyber-attacks.
